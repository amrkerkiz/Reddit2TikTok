# Reedit2TikTok bot

## Intro
The content found on TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram accumulates millions of views collectively, demanding minimal input. The crux of originality often lies solely in editing and content compilation...

... Yet, envision a scenario where this procedure could be automated.

## Steps
1. Read Reddit API and store text posts.
2. Get screenshots of those posts and top comments.
3. Create Audio files for reading title and comments.
4. Edit the video with the post and sound.
5. Upload video to TikTok

## Installation
1. Clone repository.
2. Create a personal Reddit application script using the following link https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps. Store personal use script and secret token.
3. Edit the constants.txt file with those tokens and the Reddit account username and password.
4. Run MainSetup.py.

## Dependencies
* Python libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt

### Note
Currently, one must manually upload saved videos. While utilizing the TikTok API for this purpose is possible, obtaining personal access proves to be challenging.
